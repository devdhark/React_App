Video Game Library:

This project is a User Interface for a Video Game Library Website.
The code is all in Typescript with React and the idea is to create new custom made React componenets to provide a 
scalable and functional user interface.
Some of the reusable components developed are:
- Game Card: A card description of a Video Game which contains a photo and details about the game. 
- Game Grid which contains all the game cards
- Navigation Bar which can be used to search the library.
- Filter Dropdown menu's which is used to filter by a particular attribute like categories.
